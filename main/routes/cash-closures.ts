/**
 * Day-close (cierre de caja, issue #649).
 *
 * One close per store per tenant business day. POST /api/cash-closures:
 *  - Owner-only (manager/cashier/server are 403).
 *  - Validates: YYYY-MM-DD format, not in the future, integer cents >= 0.
 *  - Recomputes the day's aggregates server-side (never trusts client totals)
 *    using the verbatim financial-summary template (main/routes/reports.ts)
 *    for display totals, plus the drawer-reality rules:
 *      * `expected_cash_cents`: opening float plus active Pay In, Pay Out, and
 *        Safe Drop movements, cash sales from the raw pre-join
 *        `method = 'cash'` filter, and cash refunds by `refunds.created_at`
 *        (the day the cash left the drawer, not the day the original bill was
 *        paid).
 *      * `tax_components_json`: aggregated via `aggregateTaxComponents`
 *        against the spec's DisplayTaxComponent[] shape, so Z rows carry the
 *        same tax components the live report endpoint returns.
 *      * payment-method lines keyed by `b.paid_at` (not per-line timestamps)
 *        so an installment-paid bill lands whole on its settlement day,
 *        reconciling with gross/staff/tax; live reports keep per-line keys.
 *  - Snapshots the result with the operator's counted cash and stores one
 *    immutable row in `cash_closures`. Duplicate POST against the same
 *    `business_date` (scope='day') is rejected with 409 via SELECT-then-INSERT
 *    inside `withTxn`; the partial index `cash_closures_one_day` is the
 *    concurrency safety net.
 *
 * Sales flow is deliberately untouched: `createRefund`, `shift_id`, and
 * `refunds.shift_id` are unchanged — the drawer-reality attribution
 * (cash refunds by `refunds.created_at`) is read straight from the existing
 * `refunds` table without backfilling any column. The `scope='session'`
 * extension door is intentionally unused by this endpoint; session-style
 * closes arrive as separate rows with a different `scope` value.
